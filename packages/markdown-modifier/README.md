# `@saraswati-js/markdown-modifier`

Don't bother me about this name. It's terrible, I know.

Also, I would prefer if this were done via a markdown preprocessor like unified and put to string but they say:
> `remark-stringify` will do its best to serialize markdown to match the syntax tree, but there are several cases where that is impossible. Itâ€™ll do its best, but complete roundtripping is impossible given that any value could be injected into the tree. (`v9.0.1`)

So a regex will be fine and is already pretty fast so that's good too.

## NOTE
This will be best as a remark plugin but I don't want to put the effort into that. So it stays as such.

## TODO
- [ ] Convert to TypeScript
- [ ] Build a dest thingy for TS
- [ ] Add actual tests
- [ ] Watch file changes on start directory

```
markdown modifier
  - image files
  - imports
    - local
    - remote
  - Tabs
    - Inline?
    - New pages?
```

Figure out plan for how to do
  - API Docs (Swagger)
  - Components
  - How to chunk components to specific pages/routes

```js
(?:!\<import\>\((.*?)\))
!<import>(./some/file/path/markdown.md)
!(import)[./some/file/path/markdown.md]
```
