Just an example.

Would be really sweet if I could just auto reload the browser tab whenever I make a change and it'll refresh this HTML file. I don't want a heavy solution to do it but why is it so hard to do simply? Arrrrrgggggggg .....

What I want:
1. Start up up with `nodemon`
    - It's watching *.js and *.md files to change
1. On code or content changes `nodemon` will reload
1. When `nodemon` reloads the browser will refresh.
1. Boom, done. Why is that such a bother to ask?
